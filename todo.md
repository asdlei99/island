#Todo

* have one encoder per renderpass
    * make sure encoder stores into correct (local) frame
    * add minimal encoder methods
    * add storage to encoder - somewhere to store scissors, viewports, buffer
      data - so that it can be pieced back together later.

------------------------------

* Create a templating script to generate class scaffold so you don't have to
  type that much boilerplate.
